        "content": "My educational journey began at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) Banipur, West Bengal, where I learned the importance of hard work, discipline, and commitment. I was selected for Dakshana JEE coaching (JNV Kottayam, Kerala) after Class 10 through NDST (Navodaya Dakshana Selection Test), which exposed me to competitive exams and the pressure of time management. After JEE, I choose Computer Science and Engineering B.Tech at Tezpur University. My time at Tezpur University has been full of opportunities for personal growth, academic learning, and involvement in extracurricular activities, which have helped me develop both as a student and as an individual."
